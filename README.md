# Introduction to Python, Jupyter, Conda

This is an introduction to using Conda and Jupyter for scientific research projects. The contents are based on materials from Neurohackademy and lessons put together by Tal Tarkoni, and has been heavily modified for Brainhack NY.

Additional setups are required in your `base` conda environment to run interactive widgets. In your terminal, with the `base` environment active:

```
(base)$ conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=11.9.0
(base)$ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@2.0
```
